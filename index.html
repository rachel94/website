                  <h2>&ldquo;mkd3: Learn about your Literature&rdquo;</h2>
                  <h4 class="first">Overview</h4>
                  <p class="left last">For my senior research project for my undergrad program, <a class="subtle2" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/" target="_blank">Knowledge Integration</a>, I created a software to help researchers learn more about academic papers. <em>mkd3</em> produces interactive graphs using <a class="subtle2" href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> based on the results of a search on Web of Science, Scopus, or PubMed. I made use of <a href="http://networkslab.org/project/metaknowledge/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">metaknowledge</a>, a Python library for analyzing metadata from academic databases, <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">D3</a> to create visualizations, <a href="https://spacy.io/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">spaCy</a> and <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">gensim</a> for natural language processing, <a href="https://networkx.github.io/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">networkx</a> for network visualizations, and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">Django</a> to create the web app.</p>

                  <h4>Functionality</h4>
                  <p class="left" style="margin-bottom: 16px">Users can input metadata files from search results from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed to <em>mkd3</em>. To create a report, Python scripts run in which <a href="http://networkslab.org/project/metaknowledge/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">metaknowledge</a> analyzes the metadata. JSON objects are produced, which is read into the HTML pages for the report using JavaScript. <a class="subtle2" href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>, a JavaScript library for data visualization, is used to create interactive graphs of the provided data.</p>

                  <p class="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Bar graphs include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The top papers based on citation count.</li>
                    <li>The distribution of papers over years (see Figure 1).</li>
                    <li>Each of the top authors, top journals, and top subjects (see Figure 2) based on number of papers.</li>
                    <li>Natural language processing, computed with Python library <a href="https://spacy.io/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">spaCy</a>, is used to create a bar graph of the words that occur in the most papers&rsquo; titles, abstracts, or author keywords, as well as a list of papers that are likely to be review articles.</li></ul>
                  <p class="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Network visualizations, created with <a href="http://networkslab.org/project/metaknowledge/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">metaknowledge</a> and <a href="https://networkx.github.io/" target="_blank" class="subtle2">networkx</a>, a Python library for working with networks, include:</p>
                  <ul><li>A co-authorship network.</li>
                    <li>A co-citation network, showing which papers share citing papers (Figures 3 &amp; 4).</li>
                    <li>A bibliographic coupling network, showing which papers cite the same papers.</li>
                    <li>A co-occurrence network, showing papers that share word use in their titles, abstracts, or author keywords.</li></ul>
                  <p class="left">Clicking on any bar in a graph opens a new tab with a list of all the papers which make up that bar, along with their abstracts, displayed in MLA format. Users can click to switch between citation styles. From here, users can click to access each paper online.</p>
                  <p class="left last">Each graph is accompanied by an explanation of how to read and interpret it, and suggestions for how this information could influence research. Additional information about bibliometrics and the visualizations is provided on a linked page for those who are interested.</p>

                  <h4>My Process</h4>
                  <p class="left last">I began by doing research on the literature review process to better understand the needs of my users, as well as learning the necessary technical skills. I conceptualized what the app could look like by starting with some sketches, moving onto a wireframe, a high fidelity prototype, and then creating a webpage using HTML and CSS with static images as placeholders for the interactive graphs. I developed three personas based on secondary research, and I conducted user testing to get feedback on the app during development.</p>

                  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                  <p class="left last">At this stage, <em>mkd3</em> can run on a local server on the user&rsquo;s machine, but I plan to continue to develop it to make it available online.</p>

                  <h4>Example Visualizations</h4>
                  <p class="left last">The following are graphs and network visualizations produced by <em>mkd3</em> using metadata obtained from a search for &ldquo;oil spill* Mediterranean&rdquo; on Web of Science.</p>

                  <h2>&ldquo;The Cognitive Casino&rdquo; Museum Exhibit</h2>

                  <h4>Overview</h4>
                  <p class="left last">For our third year capstone project, I was part of a team of six students who created a museum exhibit about cognitive biases and casino games. Our exhibit was on display to the public on our campus for a week. This was an important part of our program because of the interdisciplinary nature of museum exhibits, the design, collaboration, and communication skills learned and developed while creating an exhibit, and the opportunity to learn about different pedagogical approaches used in exhibit design.</p>

                  <h4>Our Exhibit</h4>
                  <p class="left">The first section of our exhibit introduced visitors to four cognitive biases through examples that visitors would likely have experienced in their lives.</p>
                  <img class="museum center" src="img/examples.jpg" alt="First section of our museum exhibit, introducing two cognitive biases: losses disguised as wins, and near miss" style="width: 300px;">
                  <p class="first left">Visitors then entered the middle section of our exhibit, which we designed to feel like a casino. Here, visitors could interact with a slot machine simulator, scratch cards, and a roulette wheel to learn about how these games relate to cognitive biases.</p>
                  <img class="museum center" src="img/casino.jpg" alt="Middle section of our museum exhibit, designed to look like a casino, showing the scratch cards activity" style="width: 400px">
                  <p class="first left last">The final section of our exhibit demonstrated two other activities that relate to these cognitive biases, and provided visitors an opportunity to reflect on what they learned.</p>
                  <img class="museum center" src="img/reflection.jpg" alt="The reflection section in the final section of our exhibit" style="width: 300px">

                  <h4>Our Process</h4>
                  <p class="left">We began with many rounds of convergent and divergent brainstorming of topics that could be taught in an exhibit. For the first few months we continued to conceptualize ideas, bringing sketches to our meetings of ideas for the layout of the exhibit or an idea for a specific experience. We shared these ideas, offered feedback, and made decisions about particular aspects of our design. By the end of the fourth month, we&rsquo;d made a storyboard document showing what visitors would do in each part of the exhibit, using images created on SketchUp, sample didactic text (text that would be displayed in our exhibit), and descriptive text. Myself and another group member learned how to use SketchUp to help demonstrate these ideas.</p>
                  <p class="left">After this, we divded up tasks. I was responsible for organizing and delegating all tasks related to didactics (museum text). I wanted to take this on as it would allow me to use my attention to detail and editing skills to ensure that our text was exactly how we wanted it before having it printed, and it allowed me to use my visual design skills when formatting the text. In this role, I delegated related tasks by asking my group members what they were interested in taking on, and I scheduled these roles by working backwards from the date I wanted to have the text printed, leaving a few weeks before the date of our exhibit as a precaution.</p>
                  <p class="left">We all took on tasks in many different &ldquo;departments&rdquo;, working together and being there for each other to help with unexpected tasks or delays. Over the course of these months I was involved in brainstorming ideas, writing and editing text, formatting text, creating and editing images, painting doors (which form the walls of the exhibit), painting letters, installing shelves, hanging didactic text, and helping with other tasks related to assembling our exhibit.</p>
                  <p class="left last">After creating this exhibit, we were all proud of what we&rsquo;d created, and equally happy with the way we had worked together and supported each other throughout the process. I look forward to future opportunities to work as part of a team on any sort of project, where I would bring my enthusiasm, creativity, cooperation, and responsibility to the group.</p>

                  <h2>Museum Exhibit Visitor Study</h2>
                  <h4>Overview</h4>
                  <p class="left">As part of our museum exhibit project, my group members and I designed, conducted, and analyzed the results of a visitor study. Visitor studies are tools that help museum designers assess the effectiveness of some aspect of an exhibit.</p>
                  <p class="left last">Our study looked at whether a closed curtain blocking the view outside the exit of our exhibit affected visitors&rsquo; engagement in the reflection activities at the end of our exhibit. These reflection activities consisted of a voting activity that asked visitors to reflect on their own experienced based on what they learned, and a written activity where visitors could contribute other examples of when they&rsquo;ve experienced the cognitive biases we taught them about. We used two dependent variables to measure engagement: the amount of time spent in the reflection section, and the rate of participating visitors (measured by counting the number of sticky notes and voting chips used to interact with our these activites) compared to all visitors (measured by counting the total number of visitors).</p>

                  <h4>Our Process</h4>
                  <p class="left">About halfway through the design of our exhibit, we began brainstorming what we might like to analyze, considering both what would be of interest and what was possible given the design of our exhibit. After deciding on a topic, we brainstormed how we could include a curtain in the physical design of our exhibit without hindering vistor&rsquo;s experience, as well as how we could measure visitor engagement. Based on secondary research, it made sense for us to use both time spent and rate of participation as measures. We then brainstormed how we could best take these measurements without disrupting the experience for visitors.</p>
                  <p class="left">I contributed to this study by helping with the research design, collecting data, and analyzing the results. I contributed to writing a research proposal before we began the study. I helped create a schedule to organize which group members would be present during each shift to time visitors, and I helped with data collection.</p>
                  <p class="left last">After collecting data, myself and another group member played a large role in analyzing the data. After removing some outliers, we used two-sample t-tests to compare the results between the times when the curtain was open and the times when it was closed. We did separate tests for the time variable and the two participation variables represented by the two separate reflection activities. Our null hypothesis was that there was no difference in visitor engagement when the curtain was open and when it was closed.</p>

                  <h4>Results</h4>
                  <p class="left last">The t-tests produced a p-value that did not allow us to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there was no significant difference in visitor participation when the curtain was open and when it was closed. So, we found that the status of the curtain blocking the exit had no significant effect on visitor engagement in our reflection activities. Further research into the relationship between enclosed spaces and visitor engagement would be needed to make any conclusions.</p>

                  <h2>User Testing of Messaging App</h2>
                  <p class="first left last">For a user centered design methods class (SYDE 348 at University of Waterloo), I used user testing methods to assess the usability and user experience of a messaging app, specifically for use in group project communication. These methods included secondary research and observations which led to the development of personas, walkthrough methods, desirability testing, love letter and break-up letter, and surveys. While I conducted this research as if my goal were to make improvements to the app, the main goal of my research was to learn about and gain experience using these methods.</p>

                  <h4>Persona Development</h4>
                  <p class="left">I began with secondary research and observations to develop two personas and gain a basic understanding of the platform&rsquo;s users. My secondary research consisted of reading peer reviewed literature, gray literature, and forums. Topics of these included the app itself, users&rsquo; opinions about the app, and studies conducted about the effectiveness of other messaging apps for group projects and academic purposes. I also observed students&rsquo; use of messaging platforms for group project communication. I was able to use participant observation because of my involvement in group projects.</p>
                  <p class="left last">This research allowed me to create preliminary personas, which represent typical users and were helpful to keep in mind while assessing the usability and user experience of this app.</p>

                  <h4>Walkthroughs</h4>
                  <p class="left last">I conducted master-apprentice walkthroughs with two users to see how they use other messaging platforms for group project communication, and with one user to see how they currently use the platform of interest in for group project communication. I conducted design walkthroughs with three users for this messaging app, to get an understanding of users&rsquo; experiences during the sign up process.</p>

                  <h4>Desirability Testing</h4>
                  <p class="left last">During one design walkthrough for the process of signing up for the app, I used desirability testing to better understand their experience. The user was given emotion words written on sticky notes from which they could identify how they felt during the walkthrough. I asked them to draw faces to accompany these emotions. I found that using emotion words and drawings helped the user provide more detailed feedback.</p>

                  <h4>Love Letter &amp; Break-up Letter</h4>
                  <p class="left last">I asked users to write about their experiences using this app in the style of both a love letter and a break-up letter, to understand some of their stronger feelings about the app. This was an interesting way to learn about the aspects they really like or dislike.</p>

                  <h4>Surveys</h4>
                  <p class="last left">I used a survey to ask questions about users&rsquo; preferences when deciding upon and using a messaging platform for group project communication. This allowed me to get a larger number of responses, so that I could begin to identify patterns and trends among responses.</p>

                  <p class="left first last">My goal was to learn how to use these methods and to assess the usability and user experience of an app. Even though my goal was not to make changes to this app, this experience was valuable in teaching me how to use these methods, as well as in considering how to make recommendations about a software based on the results of user centered research.</p>
